Baseball Performance and Team Efficiency Case Study

Objective:
Analyze team and player performance over multiple seasons using publicly available baseball
data from Retrosheet. Your goal is to transform raw game logs (and other available data as
necessary) into a structured and scalable dataset that supports exploration of team efficiency,
player contributions, and game dynamics. Emphasis should be placed on data modeling and
outlining how the pipeline could be operationalized for ongoing use by an MLB exec or team
owner.

Instructions:
Using Retrosheet datasets, extract, clean, and structure the data to support downstream analysis.
Design a relational schema and consider how to enable efficient querying and long-term
maintainability of the dataset.

Key Considerations:
1. Data Preparation
- Use Python and SQL to ingest and transform data from Retrosheet
(https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm).
- Identify fields relevant to team performance, game outcomes, etc.
- Structure the data to enable multi-season comparison and querying.
2. Schema Design
- Define a relational schema that captures core entities such as games, teams, and
players.
- Document the schema and explain key modeling decisions.
3. Data Pipeline & Operationalization
- Outline how you would automate and maintain the extraction and transformation
process.
- Consider factors such as scalability, scheduling, data quality, and extensibility.
- Suggest how the data could be surfaced to non-technical stakeholders (e.g.,
executives, analysts).
4. Demonstrating Usability
- Provide one or more examples of how the structured dataset could be used to
answer high-level questions related to performance or strategy.
- These examples are meant to illustrate the value of the model rather than serve as
a deep analysis. Feel free to use a visualization tool of your choice.

Deliverables:
• Python and SQL scripts for data extraction and transformation.
• Relational schema documentation.
• Summary of how the data could be used and operationalized.
